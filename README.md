Kaggle Competition - Disaster Tweet
**Overview**:
This repository contains code and resources for the Kaggle competition "Disaster Tweet." The competition's goal is to develop a machine learning model to classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not.

Data:
The dataset consists of labeled tweets, with a binary target variable indicating whether a tweet is disaster-related or not. You can find the dataset on Kaggle here.

Files
train.csv: Training data with labels.
test.csv: Test data for making predictions.

Logic
Take data
Apply Tokenization
Cleaned the data: Hyphens, Numbers, Punctuation, removing unnecessary white space, Contractions words
Convert string to lowercase
Apply Lemmatization
Plot WordCloud
Apply Vectorization
Baseline Model: MultinomialNB() / svm.SVC()
Add vectorization.transform function to pipeline and model.predict to pipeline

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt.
Use the provided code and notebooks to build and evaluate your model.
Make predictions on the test set and submit your results to Kaggle.
